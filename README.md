# faeminaPID

## Overview
This repository contains the hardware design and firmware for a PID controller specifically tailored for vintage Faema Faemina coffee machines. Utilizing the powerful and versatile ESP32 microcontroller, this project aims to modernize and improve the consistency of your classic coffee machine. The firmware for this project is based on the popular ESPhome platform.

## Features
- **PID Control**: Achieve consistent temperatures inside the boiler for exact brew temperature.
- **ESP32 Powered**: Leverage the capabilities of the ESP32 for WiFi connectivity, over-the-air updates, and more.
- **ESPhome Firmware**: Built on the popular home automation firmware platform, ESPhome, for seamless integration with Home Assistant.

## Project Structure
- `Hardware/`: Contains all relevant hardware design files. (Coming soon)
- `Firmware/`: The ESPhome firmware components.
- `Docs/`: All the necessary datasheets of the hardware used in this project.

## Status
The hardware design for this project is still in progress.
